# hello-world

My name is Rayn Jackson.  I like red pull apart twizzlers and black licorice.  I also love jelly donuts.  I am a teacher and communicator of the principles of the circular economy. I believe in biomimicry - that nature's genius holds all answers to our problems. I'm a realist and unrealized creative.
